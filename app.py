## Welcome to the Sea Ice Preservation Simulator

This interactive tool allows you to explore how reducing ocean surface salinity 
could help preserve and expand sea ice formation in polar regions, particularly the Arctic.

### What You Can Do:

1. **Learn** about the relationship between salinity and sea ice formation
2. **Calculate** freshwater requirements for salinity reduction
3. **Simulate** potential ice expansion based on salinity changes
4. **Compare** different geoengineering approaches
5. **Save** your simulation scenarios and results to the database

### Why This Matters:

> "The preservation of sea ice is vital for maintaining Earth's climate balance and protecting delicate 
> marine ecosystems. By understanding the dynamics of salinity and its connection to sea ice formation, 
> we can explore possible interventions to preserve sea ice and mitigate the impacts of climate change."

    ### Salinity and Ice Formation
    
    - Freshwater (lower salinity) has a higher freezing point than saltwater
    - When surface water salinity decreases, ice formation becomes easier
    - Lower salinity helps create stratification, with fresher water staying at the surface
    - This stratification insulates ice from warmer water below

    ### Climate Benefits of Sea Ice
    
    - Sea ice reflects sunlight (high albedo), reducing heat absorption
    - When ice melts, darker ocean water absorbs more heat (feedback loop)
    - Preserving ice helps maintain this reflectivity
    - Ice formation also affects ocean circulation patterns
