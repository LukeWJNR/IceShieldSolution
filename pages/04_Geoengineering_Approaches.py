    #### Ship Design Concept
    
    A fleet of purpose-built desalination vessels could:
    
    - Be converted from oil tankers or LNG carriers
    - Include modular desalination units
    - Use nuclear power (similar to icebreakers)
    - Operate seasonally in strategic locations
    - Produce and distribute freshwater directly
    
    Each large ship could produce ~500,000 m³ of freshwater daily.

    #### Operational Strategy

    - Target areas with temperatures just above freezing
    - Operate during early freezing season (Fall)
    - Create strategic freshwater "lenses" at the surface
    - Monitor and adjust based on real-time conditions

# Final thoughts
st.subheader("Path Forward")

st.markdown("""
The complex challenge of preserving sea ice will likely require multiple complementary approaches, 
potentially including salinity reduction alongside other strategies. A recommended path forward would include:

1. **Small-scale field trials** to test different methodologies
2. **Comprehensive monitoring systems** to evaluate impacts
3. **International coordination** for governance and implementation
4. **Continued investment** in climate mitigation alongside geoengineering
5. **Adaptive approach** that evolves based on results and observations

Sea ice preservation represents one potential tool in addressing climate change, but should be 
viewed as a component of broader climate action rather than a standalone solution.
